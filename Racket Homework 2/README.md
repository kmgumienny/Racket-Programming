This project goes over making 3 kinds of storms; hurricanes, thunderstorms, and fires. There are functions that accept all three of these natural disasters. The helper functions check variables depending on the type of disaster and return variables accordingly. In addition, object variables are modified for any of the three all with one function. There are check-expects that test the functions and their implementations.
